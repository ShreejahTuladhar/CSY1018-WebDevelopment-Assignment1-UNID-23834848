    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>
        The objective of this assignment is to create a website using html and CSS. While making a website understanding
        of the programming language and its execution is important. This assignment's challenges are to be creative and
        to apply the things learned in the class. At first, I planned to do the assignment on my own without any
        reference or help only to realize how difficult that would be, so I did what I can and rest of the difficult
        parts I consulted with my friends, teacher and the internet (YouTube, W3school, and others).

    <h2>What is the website about?</h2>
    <p>This website is a short description about me. The home page is a simple greetings page. Then in portfolio page
        few pictures of myself. Then contact page has my contacts and a form. Then in work experience page is a short
        version of my resume. Then the last page is this one, the site report page where I will write report on what
        happened while doing this assignment. </p><br>

    <h3>home page</h3>
    <p>The home page is a greeting from me. Here I have my name and my picture. This page will let the person viewing
        know who I am. This page took the most time to make because it was the primary layout and it had nav menu and a
        hamburger icon made.</p>

    <h2>conclusion</h2>
    <p>The best part about this assignment is learning that I can create more website like this. Writing the first html
        page using only HTML, adding images, adding links, making a table, etc. Then learning CSS was a whole new area
        of decorating the designs of webpages. There is so much more to learn yet it seems like I have understood it all
        because the syntaxes are easy to understand. Even though there were many challenges like the hamburger icon and
        responsive design which were new to me, I did my research and seek help from my friends, teacher, and the
        internet which reduced my stress a lot. This assignment encourages me to do more in the future.
